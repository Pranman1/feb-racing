"""Raceline: minimum-curvature path inside the track, then a speed profile.

Minimum curvature (the usual first-order approximation of minimum time on a narrow track):
every centreline sample i may move sideways by alpha_i along its normal, within the track less
a margin for the car's half width. Curvature is approximated by the second difference of the
positions, which is linear in alpha, so the objective is a quadratic in alpha and the problem
is a box-constrained QP. CasADi's qrqp solves it in milliseconds; ipopt is the fallback.

Speed profile: the lateral-acceleration limit caps speed at each point from the curvature;
a forward pass limits acceleration and a backward pass limits braking, both run twice around
the loop so the closure is consistent.
